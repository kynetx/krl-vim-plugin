This a vim plugin for krl (Kynex Rule Language) vim support. It includes: 
	syntax highlighting
	snippets for use with snipMate (https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim)

For installation, we recommend pathogen by Tim Pope (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). Just clone this repo into your bundle directory. If you aren't using pathogen, then you can install the plugin the old-school way by copying the directories into your .vim directory.

I also recommend the PastelsOnDark theme that has KRL specific highlighting at: https://github.com/mikefarmer/pastelsondark-vim
